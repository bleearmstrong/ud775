Being able to look at two files side by side
so to speak allowed us to see what differences
were in the files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I could be less hesitant about trying new changes, and be more organized.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Cons: I may not commit enough.
Pros: I have more control over it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Fundamentally different objects

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log --grep="Whatever" to find commit comments, and git diff id1 id2 to see the differences  between two files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Much more willing to not care if stuff breaks

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
so much r code
